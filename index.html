                <p>My Name is Akolade O Oke, I have been on the surfcae of the Earth for some decades ago and I
                    practically spent all of my childhood and some substancial aspect of my adulthood in Africa. Growing
                    up was a thing i never believed will be a reality because, i was the Last child of Nine Children.
                </p>

                <p> Back then in Africa, the Last child is peculiar with enjoying comfort from the Father and Mother and
                    the entire Family. But my case was different. As young as i was, my job is to serve everyone in the
                    family, up to my immediate elder sister. I was misrable and when i look at my Brothers and Sister,
                    they look like a giant while, i was just like a grasshoper. I can't complain or refuse to carry out
                    their instructions! So i thought i will never ever move beyond serving my siblings.</p>

                <P> Not until recent that, i was struck by realisation: you may not be able to influence your birth
                    position, but you can change your role in the family to be Father for all. But it is alot of hard
                    work. </P>
